# CoinChaseGame
A simple two dimensional game built using C++ and SFML.

The goal of the game is to collect spawning coins while avoiding static obstacles and an enemy. The enemy has basic AI. It wanders around the screen while you move. When a coin is collected, the enemy becomes aware and chases you for a fixed duration, after which it goes back to wandering around.
